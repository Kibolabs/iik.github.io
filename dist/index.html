		  <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
		  <p>
			I believe that teaching in higher education is coaching and facilitating knowledge transfer through carefully directing and supporting learning. Teachers should ensure that learning is not blocked and should encourage self-realization and personalized learning. The teacher should not obstruct or hinder learning either intentionally or not. Teachers should therefore understand their idiosyncrasies which may inhibit learning and be wary of them as they teach.
		 </p>
		  <p>
			Learning occurs when a student takes control of what is being learned, toy with it and is able to push its boundaries using his imagination or creativity to test the knowledge they acquired. Learners should therefore be encouraged and systematically guided to contextualize their understanding of learned concepts. I believe even the most boring class if given the rigour and keen interest meaning can be found and would become interesting.

		  <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Adjustments to Teaching and Learning</h2>
  
		  <p>
			As a new lecturer i though good lectures are the ones who digest and present high quality content. I was determined to leave the students impressed by the enthusiasm, the content quality and clarity. However, I learned that leaving them impressed is about me and not about the students. I therefore learned that students are not there to judge the lecturer’s abilities or qualities but to learn and that requires a deeper thinking towards the approaches and theory behind deeper learning and restructuring teaching centred from state of the art didactic techniques.

		  <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
		  <p>
			I believe that teaching in higher education is about coaching and facilitating knowledge acqusition. This is through carefully directing the flow of knowledge and providing the necesary and personalized support to learners. Teachers should ensure that learning is not blocked and should encourage self-realization and personalized learning. The teacher should not obstruct or hinder learning either intentionally or not. Teachers should therefore understand their idiosyncrasies which may inhibit learning and be wary of them as facilitate knowledge transferance.
		 </p>
		  <p>
			Learning occurs when students takes control of what is being learned, toy with it and are able to push its boundaries using imagination or creativity testing the knowledge they acquired. Learners should therefore be encouraged and systematically guided to contextualize their understanding of learned concepts. I believe there are no boring subjects. Therefore, learning any subject, if given the rigour and cultivated interest, the meaning in what is learned is visualized and true learning occurs.

			<h2> Welcome to My Class: Here Why I do what I do
			</h2>
			<p>
				To effectively facilitate learning a teacher should learn the current social and environmental context and constraints of the learners. For example, If you are teaching a class that is obsessed with anime, learn a few things about anime that can be used in class to contextualize the subject. Importantly research shows that digital learners/NetGen’er’s have several characteristics that influence their interests in what is being learned. Oblinger 2004 theorizes that the current generation of college students (ages 18-22) are experiential learners who prefer to learn by doing, instead of learning by listening. NetGen’ers are community-oriented; to them, friends, relationships and contributions to the community are essential. NetGen’ers’ learning preferences lean towards teamwork, experiential activities and the use of technology. Their strengths include multitasking, goal orientation, a positive attitude and a collaborative style.

			<p>
				With the rapid advancement in technology including AI these new learners are focused on nurturing skills necessary to have a meaningful and fulfilling career in this modern-high tech society. These learners, therefore, need to be engaged in a way that fosters creativity, and innovation using technology. As such, a modern lecturer should creatively contextualize the subject. For example, in my practice, I found several techniques useful in delivering and assessing the learners. Examples include in-class group activities, peer assessment, games and game design and competitive challenges. The technologies used must be relevant and intuitive. Students engage more with activities using the latest technologies, online live dashboards and polls to facilitate engagements. Platforms such as hackerrank are useful tools for my programming and problem-based courses. Importantly, assessment and content which help develop the student personally are engaging and meaningful to the students. For example, helping students develop their online portfolios as part of a web-development course has resulted in meaningful learning.

		  <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Adjustments to Teaching and Learning</h2>
  
		  <p>
			As a new lecturer I had preconceptions that good lectures are the ones who digest and present high quality content. I was determined to leave the students impressed by the rigor, the content quality and clarity. However, I learned that leaving them impressed is about me and not about the students. I therefore learned that teaching is more an art than it is a science. It requires a creative deployment of the relevant didactic theories behind deeper learning. The insturctor is learning and re-learning constantly and apply innovative mechanisms to influence knowledge acquisition.
